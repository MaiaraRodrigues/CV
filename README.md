## Tech Education

#### Makers Academy (Sept'20 to Dec'20)

In the 16 weeks at Makers, I had the opportunity to learn and apply best practice in Software Design. The focus was on learning skills rather than techniques, and therefore I have been trained in OOP, TDD, SRP and BDD principles. Thanks to the imprinting received, I am committed to TDD and to the idea of crafting software that is clean, readable, maintainable. I learned to work by XP Values and follow Agile processes. During the course I built projects using:

- Languages: Ruby, Javascript, SQL, jQuery, React
- Frameworks: Rails
- Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Jasmine, Mocha/Chai, Capybara
- ORM:  PostgreSql
- HTML, CSS
- Deployment: Heroku, Travis CI
- Version control via Github 

## Skills

#### Communication 

I love to communicate with others so much so that I learnt two new human languages from scratch, just so I could talk more. While working in hospitality and telecommunications I acquired great communication skills, handling customer service enquiries and surrounded by a team. 
A standard day at Makers included afternoons of pair-programming where I would enjoy working asking many questions and requesting feedback so I am able to continue to grow and develop as a programmer.


#### Self-Learning 

At age 5 I taught myself to read and since then I have never stopped looking for opportunities to continue growing, learning, and improving. I changed professions drasticaly more than once because I knew I would be able to teach myself something new. Makers Academy has shown me that I have the ability to pick up new technologies quickly to a high level within a short space of time. I am very curious and creative, currently I am leaning UX/UI principles. 


#### Team-work 

At Makers I looked foward to the team projects where everyone would share their ideas and we would plan a project together. Today I can say I made friends from my cohort that I will have for life. One of the main selling points of coding for me is that development is a process which holds team work at its heart.I am looking to join a supportive team, in a role that would both challenge me and allow me to grow.
