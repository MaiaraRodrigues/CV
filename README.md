Welcome to the new chapter of my life! 

I am a deeply curious, adaptable and trillingual **Full Stack Software Developer**, recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). 
I am passionate about challenging myself learning new things and bringing new ideas into projects. Eager to start a new role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, aligning with a team that values feedback, communication and inclusivity, as well as continual growth. 
During my Makers journey I had the opportunity of developing my programming skills, learning the best practices of software engineering and enjoying being part of a team, where I made friends for life. </div>

## Tech Education

#### Makers Academy (Sept'20 to Dec'20)

In the 16 weeks at Makers, I had the opportunity to learn and apply best practice in Software Design. The focus was on learning skills rather than techniques, and therefore I have been trained in OOP, TDD, SRP and BDD principles. Thanks to the imprinting received, I am committed to TDD and to the idea of crafting software that is clean, readable, maintainable. I learned to work by XP Values and follow Agile processes. During the course I built projects using:

- Languages: Ruby, Javascript, SQL, jQuery, React
- Frameworks: Rails
- Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Jasmine, Mocha/Chai, Capybara
- ORM:  PostgreSql
- HTML, CSS
- Deployment: Heroku, Travis CI
- Version control via Github 

## Skills

#### Communication 

I love to communicate with others so much so that I learnt two new human languages from scratch, just so I could talk more. While working in telecommunications and hospitality I acquired great communication skills, surrounded by a team and handling customer service enquiries. 
A standard day at Makers included afternoons of pair-programming where I would enjoy working asking questions and requesting feedback, so I am able to continue to grow and develop as a programmer.


#### Self-Learning 

At age 4 I learn to read and since then I have never stopped looking for opportunities to continue growing, learning, and improving. I changed professions drasticaly because I knew I would be able to teach myself something new. Makers Academy has shown me that I have the ability to pick up new technologies quickly to a high level and within a short space of time. I am very curious and creative, currently I am leaning UX/UI principles. 


#### Team-work 

At Makers I looked foward to the team projects where everyone would share their ideas and we would plan a project together. Today I can say I made friends from my cohort that I will have for life. One of the main selling points of coding for me is that development is a process which holds team work at its heart. I am looking to join a supportive team, in a role that would both challenge me and allow me to grow. 

#### Problem-solving

Moving countries twice and learning everything again gave me the determination to solve any problem I could encounter. I did a lot of research and planning before deciding to change my career and life, and I apply this to tech problems. Working with telecomunications and technology in the past helped me to see problems from different perspectives and try new solutions. I have great attention to detail and I am very resilient, with that and creativity there is no problem that can get on my way.
